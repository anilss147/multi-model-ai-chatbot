## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Supports Multiple AI Models**
   - Choose from a variety of pre-trained models, including:
     - **LLaMA-3** (8B and 70B variants)
     - **Mistral-7B** and **Mistral-7B-Instruct**
     - **Falcon-7B** and **Falcon-40B**
     - **LLaMA-2** (7B, 13B, and 70B variants)
     - **Mixtral-8x7B**
     - **RedPajama-INCITE-7B**
     - **MPT-7B**
   - Each model is optimized for specific tasks like conversational AI, instruction following, or general-purpose language generation.

### 2. **Dynamic Model Switching**
   - Seamlessly switch between models during a conversation without restarting the application.
   - Enables users to experiment with different models and compare their responses in real-time.

### 3. **Customizable Response Length**
   - Adjust the maximum response length using a slider in the interface.
   - Provides flexibility for generating short or detailed responses.

### 4. **Clear Chat History**
   - Reset the conversation with a single click.
   - Useful for starting fresh conversations or testing new models.

### 5. **Token Limit Management**
   - Automatically handles token limits for large models to prevent errors.
   - Ensures that input prompts and responses stay within the model's maximum token capacity.

### 6. **Runs on Google Colab or Locally**
   - **Google Colab**: Leverage free GPU resources for faster inference.
   - **Local Setup**: Run the chatbot on your own machine with GPU support for better control and privacy.

### 7. **Gradio Chat UI**
   - A clean and intuitive user interface built with **Gradio**.
   - Features include:
     - Dropdown menu for model selection.
     - Input box for user messages.
     - Chat history display for ongoing conversations.
     - Buttons to send messages and clear chat history.

### 8. **No API Key Required**
   - Fully open-source and free to use.
   - No need to sign up for external services or pay for API access.
